# **_The Formula 1 Hub - Project Portfolio 3 - Python_**

The Formula 1 Hub is a command line interface styled application that allows players to test their knowledge on Formula 1. The quiz consists of 3 different levels to choose from, granting more points for harder difficulties. The quiz has 10 questions for each difficulty and if the player answers all questions, they will receive points based on the difficulty selected. Additionally the Formula 1 Hub will allow players to view additional information regarding the upcoming Formula 1 2022 Season such as the current drivers, the 2022 calendar and some interesting Formula 1 facts.

# Objective

In my third project, I intend to create a visually appealing command line interface application where players can test their knowledge on Formula 1 and also provide some insightful, interesting and useful information regarding the upcoming 2022 season. The main objective is to demonstrate competency in Python whilst adhering to high presentation standards.

# User Experience (UX)

## Design Prototype

The very first design prototype was created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). I only designed the very bare minimum using this program so that I could have a basic idea of what I wanted to achieve. Additionally because this is a command line interface application, there is only a small amount of room to come up with ideas on how to present it so I decided that I wanted the command line interface to be housed within a computer screen to give it a more presentable look and then I would add a Formula 1 styled background to enhance the visual appearance.<br /><br />

## Site Structure

The Formula 1 Hub is a one-page website that, in the center, has a command line interface. When the application starts up, the player will be greeted with a nicely styled initial startup screen and then asked to enter a username. The application is designed with the user experience in mind so at every stage, the user will be asked if they wish to return to either the Quiz Hub Menu, F1 Info Hub Menu or the Main Menu. The application also has a 'RUN APP' button located at the bottom of the screen which the user can press and reload the application if they wish to do so.

## Python Logic

I decided to create a logic flow chart to detail the entire flow of the application. Creating this gave me a brilliant overview of how everything works and how the user will navigate the application. The logic flow chart was created using an excellent [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension called [Draw.io](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio).

![Python Logic Chart](assets/images/readme-images/f1-hub-logic-flow.png)

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The main additional typography chosen to enhance the site was to introduce ASCI art to add an additional dynamic to the presentation. The ASCI art was used for the start-up display and the thank you message when the user exits the application. 

 * ### Colour Scheme
      The application utilises a brilliant Python package called [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) which allows developers to change the colour of the text <br /><br />

# Testing

* ## Code Validation

    * The Formula 1 Hub code has been validated by using online validation tools [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and the [PEP8 Online Validator](http://pep8online.com/). I encountered many PEP8 errors and warnings however these have now been fixed and documented below. <br /><br />

    * As the JavaScript for this project has been provided by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) and I have not altered it in any way, I have been advised by my mentor that it is not a requirement to test it.

* ### HTML Validation Image

* ## Lighthouse Testing 

    * Furthermore the website has been through the [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) and [Microsoft Edge Dev Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/open/?tabs=cmd-Windows) Lighthouse Testing which tests the website for the following:
        * Performance - How the page performs whilst loading.
        * Accessibility - Is the site accessible for all players and how can it be improved.
        * Best Practices - Site conforms to industry best practices.
        * SEO - Search Engine Optimisation. Is the site optimised for search engine result rankings.

    * The lighthouse tests were conducted in incognito/private windows due to extensions interfering with the results.<br /><br />

* ### Edge Desktop Lighthouse Result
